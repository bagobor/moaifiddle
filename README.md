moaifiddle
==========

Prototype of moaifiddle website where you can create and run moai apps in the browser and share with others.
Currently in very early prototyping phase and has 0 functionality.

Basic idea is an edit window and a moaijs window, you edit code in the edit window and hit run and see it in the moaijs window.

The ability to share fiddles via embeddable iframes with links to the moaifiddle for forking/playing.

Aiming to learn the following technologies:
 * Codemirror
 * EmberJS
 * Typescript
